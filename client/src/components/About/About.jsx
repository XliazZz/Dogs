          <h2>About Me</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Elias Martinez, and I'm a passionate full stack
          web developer based in Buenos Aires. At just 20 years old, I've found my
          passion in the world of programming, and I love building functional and
          appealing web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to work on the
          development of three exciting full stack web applications
          independently. These applications are built on the REST API
          architecture and utilize a diverse set of technologies, including 
          <span className={style.Mongo}> MongoDB</span>,
          <span className={style.Postgres}> Postgres</span>,
          <span className={style.Sequelize}> Sequelize</span>,
          <span className={style.React}> React</span>,
          <span className={style.Redux}> Redux</span>,
          <span className={style.Vite}> Vite</span>,
          <span className={style.Bootstrap}> Bootstrap</span>,
          <span className={style.Html}> HTML</span>,
          <span className={style.Css}> CSS</span>,
          and 
          <span className={style.Express}> Express</span>, all powered by the mighty 
          <span className={style.Javascript}> JavaScript </span>
          programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the standout features of my projects is the option for users to
          register and log in using 
          <span className={style.G}> G</span>
          <span className={style.o}>oo</span>
          <span className={style.o2}>o</span>
          <span className={style.G}>g</span>
          <span className={style.l}>l</span>
          <span className={style.e}>e</span> or 
          <span className={style.Facebook}> Facebook </span>
          accounts, providing a
          smoother and more secure user experience by authenticating users with
          JSON Web Tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in the world of development started with my training in full
          stack web programming at Henry, an enriching experience that equipped
          me with strong technical knowledge and practical skills to tackle web
          development challenges. Currently, I'm also studying Computer Science
          at the University of Buenos Aires to further expand my knowledge and
          delve deeper into the world of computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I love exploring new technologies and trends in
          the programming world, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with other tech
          enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm excited about what the future holds, and I look forward to
          continuing to create innovative and valuable solutions in the digital
          world!
